# üêæ Feature: Pet Registration

## Overview
Pet Registration is the foundational feature that allows PawPalace to store details of any pet that interacts with the platform.

## User Story
As a pet owner or visitor, I want to register my pet in the PawPalace system so that its details are stored, and I can access other services such as vaccination, stay-care, fostering, or adoption.

## Inputs
- Pet name
- Type (Aquatic, Terrestrial, Aerial)
- Species (Dog, Cat, Fish, etc.)
- Subspecies
- Breed
- Age


## Outcomes
- A new pet record is created.
- A unique `id` is generated (read-only, system assigned).
- The pet is now eligible for all other PawPalace services.
